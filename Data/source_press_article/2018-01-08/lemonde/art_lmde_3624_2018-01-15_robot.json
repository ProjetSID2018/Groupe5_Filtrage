The crowd was totally into it, jamming, dancing, singing their hearts out amidst insane lights shows, lasers, special pyrotechnics, thumping music. Then Bono stopped and asked for quiet. As through from the heavens, a spotlight shone down on where he stood center stage. He began to snap slowly. The audience was confused. After a few snaps into the silence, he finally spoke:  << Every time I snap my fingers, an African child dies >> . Suddenly, from somewhere in the darkness, a man with a hardcore British accent shouted,  << Well bloody stop snapping then! >> \n        Lire la version francaise\n         \n     \n          << Il faut repenser la philanthropie pour l'Afrique comme une reparation de son pillage >>\n           \n Don't get me wrong, I respect Bono. The work that he and other celebrities like him have done to bring attention to causes like debt relief and HIV/AIDS treatment has saved real lives. But I recount this joke because I think it illustrates so succinctly one of the most interesting - and problematic - things about modern philanthropy: As currently practiced, philanthropy preserves existing power structures and dynamics that have caused much of the suffering it seeks to alleviate and, in so doing, operates at cross purposes to its original intention. This is especially true of Western philanthropy in Africa. Absolute power over black lives Breaking the joke down as it relates to structures and dynamics reveals this: A white man speaking from his god-like perch to a primarily white audience about Africans so wretched that this audience conflates good intentions and absolute power over black lives. If that sounds like colonialism, it's not by chance. Indeed, it is impossible to talk about philanthropy in Africa without discussing colonialism. But, first, what exactly is philanthropy? Philanthropy has been defined as the love of humanity, in the sense of caring and nourishing. Samuel Johnson called it love of mankind and good nature. In its purest form, it is a truly revolutionary act. To practice philanthropy is to recognize, fully and intimately, the inherent humanity of each and every person, especially by striving to modify the conditions that prevent people from fully realizing their true humanity. This can mean alleviating debasing poverty or fighting oppressive political structures - there are many ways to practice love of humanity, in the sense of caring and nourishing. However, the legacy of colonialism and the current mess of modern-day philanthropy in Africa complicate the matter. It is important to begin by acknowledging how difficult it is for humans - with all our different ethnicities, nationalities and races (however essentializing these terms may be) - to come up with a truly comprehensive and inclusive idea of who is and isn't human. This failure leads to schizophrenic definitions of humanness - with far-reaching consequences for the practice of philanthropy in Africa, resulting from Africa's encounter with  Europe  and European ideas of what it means to be truly human. \n        Lire aussi :\n         \n     \n                Michael Green : << Je reve d'un prix de l'echec philanthropique >>\n     \n There is abundant evidence that Africans were not considered fully human or fully part of human history in European thought, especially during the slave trade and in the years leading up to official colonialism. As the  philosopher  Immanuel Kant wrote in his 1763 Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and the Sublime:  << The Negroes of Africa have by nature no feeling that rises above the trifling... So fundamental is the difference between these two races of man, and it appears to be as great in regard to mental capacities as in color. >> This position was shared by many of Kant's contemporary Enlightenment philosophers and architects of the liberal order from which the practice of modern philanthropy grew. It is all the more disturbing considering that Kant's construct of cosmopolitanism is crucial to present-day practices of global philanthropy. Some might argue that the moral philosopher need not be perfect for his philosophy to have merit. However, the damage infectious racism has inflicted on the concept of philanthropy is so insidious and acute that it renders the concept virtually unsalvageable. For Kant's original sin in conceptualizing who counts as human within the cosmopolitan ideal raises the following vital question: If the liberal order does not consider Africans fully human, can philanthropy as a practice and a concept apply to Africans? If not, we cannot call that exchange philanthropy; we must call it something else. Dehumanization in the service of extraction This is where we the robust confusion of the colonial enterprise comes into play. This enterprise can be summed up as follows: The simple economics of Europe's industrialization demanded extraction of African resources (including humans), and justifying that extraction required codifying ever more extreme versions of Kant's racism, resulting in the familiar vicious cycle: Dehumanization in the service of extraction made Europeans wealthier while making Africans poorer and therefore less human-seeming, justifying further extraction. And so, through the ages, Africans became increasingly poor and seemingly less human, thus precipitating further extraction. Yet, paired with capitalism, liberalism can often be an extremely inconvenient set of philosophies. While Europeans may not have wanted to believe that Africans were humans, fundamentally of course they knew that they were. And so, in order to absolve themselves - and to justify the extraction - they came up with the idea of colonialism as a so-called \"civilizing mission.\" Europeans would be the custodians of Africa's vast resources until Africans grew into the ability to manage them themselves. This is the root of modern-day philanthropy in Africa. In the words of Rudyard Kipling: << Take up the White Man's burden--  The savage wars of peace--  Fill full the mouth of Famine--  And bid the sickness cease. >> What marvelous conjecture! It is as though I were to come to your house, steal your things, kick you onto the street and then proclaim to the world that I will grudgingly take up the burden of caring for your lazy, unwashed self. << A land of opportunity >> But that is all in the past, people say. What use is there in rehashing what happened decades, even centuries, ago? We are beyond that kind of thinking. If only. In fact, it is irrefutable that a colonial mindset still shapes modern ideas about European philanthropic engagement in Africa. Indeed, it is so ingrained that many of us fail to realize when we make reference to what can only be referred to as basic foolishness. To quote the ever-progressive [French President] Macron at the most recent G20 summit, for example:  << The challenge of Africa, it is totally different, it is much deeper, it is civilizational, today... At the same time, we have countries that are tremendously successful, with an extraordinary growth rate that makes people say that Africa is a land of opportunity >> . A land of opportunity for whom? Suffice it to say that when a European \"discovers\" a land of opportunity, it rarely works out very well for the natives. The upstanding King Leopold the Second of Belgium says it better than I would ever want to and perhaps more directly than Macron and other world leaders are willing to. (Warning: this is difficult to read:) << Evangelize the niggers so that they stay forever in submission to the white colonialists, so they never revolt against the restraints they are undergoing... Convert always the blacks by using the whip. Keep their women in nine months of submission to work freely for us. Force them to pay you in sign of recognition - goats, chickens or eggs - every time you visit their villages. And make sure that niggers never become rich. Sing every day that it's impossible for the rich to  enter  heaven. Make them pay tax each week at Sunday mass. Use the money supposed for the poor, to build flourishing business centers. Institute a confessional system, which allows you to be good detectives denouncing any black that has a different consciousness contrary to that of the decision-maker. Teach the niggers to forget their heroes and to adore only ours. Never present a chair to a black that comes to visit you. Don't give him more than one cigarette. Never invite him for dinner even if he gives you a chicken every time you arrive at his house. >> My point in quoting this ( whole letter here ) is threefold: First, King Leopold was not exactly a  nice  man. Second, he was perhaps a little too direct about his intentions - though he was no more invested in perpetuating the racialized system of inequality that fueled the extractive colonial dream than, say, the British, French, Portuguese, Dutch or Germans. Third, extraction and the idea that the civilizing process of extraction ultimately did Africans some good have always been intimately connected. In other words, stealing from us was in fact giving to us, a kindness for which we should, to this day, be grateful (1). << We paid for all of this >> This dynamic is so ingrained in our interactions that it results in absurd situations. I remember years ago, when I happened to be in London at the same time as my mother during her first tenure as  Nigeria 's Minister of Finance. She was there to make the case for debt relief and the only way I could squeeze into her busy schedule was by catching a ride with her between her meetings. As we sped down Whitehall, I looked out at the majestic buildings and said to her,  << This is what we need in Nigeria to turn things around, some monumental  architecture  >> . Without looking up from her papers, she said,  << But we paid for all of this. >> We did. And, in many ways, we are still paying for it. That is why Western philanthropy in present-day Africa is so perverse. In the words of the Kenyan novelist Ngugi wa Thiongo: << Why did Africa let Europe cart away millions of Africa's souls from the continent to the four corners of the wind? How could Europe lord it over a continent ten times its size? Why does needy Africa continue to let its wealth meet the needs of those outside its borders and then follow behind with hands outstretched for a loan of the very wealth it let go? >> Stealing a thousand dollars from me and then giving me a dollar as you pass by on the street cannot be called philanthropy. There is no love of humankind in that action. There is no good nature. In that action, there is no push towards changing structures that dehumanize. Yet my intention in outlining this absurd arrangement at length is not to overplay the atrocities and indignities perpetrated through colonialism. Rather, I want to lay out the situation clearly to allow modern-day philanthropists to see exactly where they can make the most impact. For me, this means moving the discussion about philanthropy in Africa towards the idea of justice. More specifically, when I refer to philanthropy reframed as  justice , what I mean very concretely is the dreaded << R >> word: reparations. Unpaid labor extracted from Africans Consider this number: 97 trillion dollars. According to  The Guardian , that is an extremely conservative estimate of all the unpaid labor extracted from Africans in North American colonies between 1619 and 1865. It does not include extraction from African countries after 1865. Nor does it include the value of non-human resources. It refers exclusively to African labor over a roughly 240-year period - labor that was absolutely fundamental in building up the very wealth in Europe and America that now makes private philanthropy possible. In contrast, philanthropic flows and official development assistance from the global North to the global South are, respectively, around 60 billion dollars a year and 150 billion dollars a year. To reach 97 trillion dollars, it would take over 1,500 years of << philanthropic >> giving and 485 years of official development assistance. \n        Lire aussi :\n         \n     \n                Agent philanthropique, un metier d'avenir\n     \n In other words, the level of wealth transfer - in this case a euphemism for robbery - that occurred created a gap so insurmountable that it is routinely ignored. At best, it invites arguments about the impossibility of paying back 97 trillion dollars. Yet there is a precedent for reparations for colonialism in Africa. In 2012, the British offered a formal apology and agreed to pay 20 million pounds to Kenyan Kikuyus unfortunate enough to have encountered the British civilizing mission of the 1950s. Obviously, the sum returned pales in comparison to the cost of dehumanization and the value of the land taken. But what matters most to people is acknowledging that wrong was done. Apology is a crucial first step towards affirming a person's humanity. Now, if philanthropy is really about love of humanity and changing structural dynamics that prevent the full expression of that love, we cannot hope to change the structural dynamics between Africa and Europe without acknowledging and righting the wrongs of the past. To lead the way in creating a new relationship, philanthropic institutions must move away from the message  << This is our money, which we are altruistically giving you >> , and towards the message  << This is your money, made from resources we wrongfully appropriated and which we are privileged to give back. >> If philanthropic relations today are rooted in the idea of African inhumanity conveyed alongside the << philanthro-colonial >> project, then there is no reason why those relations cannot also convey the argument  << Yes, you're human, I'm so sorry we took your lives, land and money >>  and be used as a foundation for change. Such a change in messaging would be a win-win situation. It would allow the West to move towards fully acknowledging its own humanity by asking for forgiveness and stepping into a space beyond absolute capitalism, which readily treats human life as a commodity. And it would allow Africans to proceed as full equals rather than second-tier characters on the world stage. And we would get some of our money back. \n        Lire aussi :\n         \n     \n                La philanthropie, un must mondain qui pourrait sauver le monde\n     \n Yet messaging is just the first step. Step two is trickier because it involves actual money. How does one calculate and then return the astronomical sum of value extracted from Africa that has built the wealth of Western nations and allowed their people to be so << philanthropic >>? How does one decide who pays? At the root of the aversion to reparations is the notion that  << my ancestors weren't colonialists or slavers >> . For many people it feels like stealing: You are taking my hard-earned money or property and giving it to benefit someone who didn't work for it. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? In the modern era, we need to stop seeing reparations as a zero-sum transfer and instead imagine a mutually beneficial enterprise. As I have already argued, admitting to the wrongdoings perpetrated against Africans allows both sides to reclaim their humanity. But we must go a step further. The challenges the world faces, the challenges Africa faces, are not African challenges, specific or containable to that continent. They are human challenges. To give just one example, climate change, which will disproportionately impact the African continent, further exacerbating issues caused by colonial extraction, is a global issue. It is not Africans who are primarily responsible for climate change; the consequences, like climate refugees will continue to move in one direction only. And unless one is prepared to build a wall and kill everyone who tries to get over it (as one mediocre French novelist has suggested), we all need to prepare for a new way of life. Imagine if we decided to use the opportunity of reparations as philanthropy to model new systems of living to prepare us for the life on earth to come. That would be philanthropy in its truest sense, transforming reparations from a third rail into an investment for all humankind. Restitution for Africa's suffering would benefit the world Let us return to the number 97 trillion to do a thought experiment. What if we set up a 97-trillion-dollar fund, based on the acknowledgement,  << This is your wealth, which we have wrongfully appropriated and are privileged to give back >> , using this fantastical-seeming but actually conservative estimate of forcefully appropriated labor as a starting point. What if we invested heavily in massive infrastructure development in Africa - power, roads, mass transit - but in a 21st-century way that treats environmental costs as real and recognizes human need as only one of a vast constellation of planetary needs? What if we used this money to re-imagine urbanization on the continent, with planners embracing the idea of increased  population  concentrations in cities and building unique and humanizing high-density living with vertical farms, waste-to-energy processes, nuclear power and more? What if we agreed to let entire sections of the continent that have suffered from exploitative extraction return to their natural states? What if we allowed depleted rainforests to grow back into massive carbon sinks while we hyper-looped between our reimagined urban centers? What if we created real opportunities for knowledge exchange, in which technical expertise made possible by years of wealth accumulation in Western countries was combined with the fresh vision of youthful African minds through future-forward educational models? This would literally be world changing. \n        Lire aussi :\n         \n     \n                La philanthropie a l'epreuve du terrain\n     \n Restitution for Africa's suffering would benefit the world. Africa has borne the painful costs of the world's wealth-building for centuries and is poised to shoulder even greater costs as the climate warms and the resulting chaos envelops the planet, breaking down current systems of organization. I cannot speak for all Africans, but I for one would gladly have my continent and my people be at the forefront of saving and improving the world that we were unwillingly conscripted to build. I would gladly use our money to ensure that all humans benefit and persevere. This is true philanthropy. If you think this is crazy, please take a moment to examine your resistance. Where does it come from? Are you sure it isn't fear, racism perhaps? I challenge you to claim that what I am suggesting is worse than collectively stealing and/or benefitting from hundreds of trillions of dollars of labor and resources from Africa and then giving back a few billion through scattered pet projects that assuage consciences but do little to actually transform the conditions that create deprivation. Has the current model, where Bob makes a billion dollars for himself by causing 20 billion in damage and then gives back a hundred million, really changed anything? Solving some problems requires pooling resources and spending strategically. Think of reparations as providing the  focus  necessary to pool philanthropic assets and restore humanity to the endeavor. That requires bold thinking and action, individuals willing to invest in a new way of thinking about giving. \n        Lire aussi :\n         \n     \n                Philanthropie : la derniere utopie\n     \n Now let me further complicate the scenario. The 97-trillion-dollar fund would need to be managed completely by Africans. Why? First, if it isn't your money, you shouldn't be the one deciding how it is spent. And yes, for those who must point it out, there is the issue of corruption across the continent, but the wrong of corruption can be tackled at the same time as the wrong of colonial extraction. If you disagree, then consider the following absurdity: Before the Swiss returned to Nigeria part of the money stashed in a Swiss bank account by one of Nigeria's  former  military dictators, they asked the Nigerians to present a plan for how they would spend it. How patronizing! Imagine someone stealing your money (after all, someone who knowingly holds stolen money and makes money off the interest is also a thief) and, then, before giving it back, telling you they are concerned that you lack the good sense to spend that money properly. This breed of nonsense surpasses all nonsense. << Don't expect anything in return >> On another level, allow me to drop a bit of wisdom from my grandfather. He told me that the African way of giving is to give completely:  << Don't ask what is done with the money and don't expect anything, not even an ounce of gratitude, in return. >>  This is something that philanthropies - especially those operating in Africa - have forgotten. They are so blinded by stereotypes of shifty Africans misusing funds that they either refuse to give directly or only give to white people working in Africa. I have seen philanthropies give young white people with zero experience and no clue money to save Africans from themselves while pointedly refusing to give money to experienced Africans because of << concerns >> about governance. A word of advice: Stop it. Assuming you believe that it's your money to give, then giving with conditions is hardly philanthropy. But, since we've determined that it isn't your money to give, I stand by my first point: You don't get to decide. And, finally, relinquishing control to another human being - the ultimate expression of trust - is actually the most important way of affirming another person's humanity. Again: true philanthropy. \n        Lire aussi :\n         \n     \n                Netflix se lance dans le cinema avec un film sur les enfants-soldats\n     \n But this is just a thought experiment. The billions of dollars in bank accounts and charitable trusts are still exactly where they were 20 minutes ago. That might make you feel secure, for now. But we all know the world is changing too rapidly for security to last. Despite what closed-border proponents say, no amount of firepower can stop the unwashed hordes from crashing your party. To the do-gooders, there are no existing philanthropic bandages to close the massive wounds opened by rapacious acquisition of wealth at Africans' expense. If we truly want a different world, we need a different way of thinking. We need to truly honor our commitment to the philanthropic essence. Humans for humans. Re-imagining philanthropy as reparations is one path towards a new way of thinking. There are certainly others. But, either way, if we want different or better results from philanthropy, we need to think and act differently. Otherwise, we need to admit to ourselves that we are not really all that interested in change and prepare for the winter (or perpetual summer) that will surely come. I think I've made it quite clear where I stand. So my question to you now is: Have you? (1) The genuineness of this letter is a matter of debate.  See this article .", "theme": "afrique"}
